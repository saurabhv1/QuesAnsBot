An effective, streamlined approach that takes work off your plate.
Coordinating patient care is anything but a smooth process. There's redundant work, failed follow-through, excess phone calls, even medical errors—all having a negative effect on patient care and financial results..
athenaCoordinator Core minimizes distractions at every stage of care coordination, starting with a streamlined order creation and transmission process. Healthcare facilities that receive orders—labs, imaging centers, hospitals, specialty providers, home health/DME, pharmacies, and more—get the right information with far less work, and are immediately connected to our growing network of providers..
This simplified electronic order transmission service delivers clean, legible orders that reduce the need for call-backs or follow-up faxes. We sift out superfluous details so you get only relevant clinical, billing, and demographic information, plus insurance eligibility status, right when you need it..
Answer your athenaCoordinator Core FAQs.
here ..
Increased Visibility.
As an in-network athenaCoordinator Core client, you receive a special designation in the athenaClinicals EHR workflow. This makes it easy for our athenahealth providers to identify our partners for improving care coordination. And with real-time access to orders via our athenaCoordinator Core Receiver Portal, your staff can take a proactive approach to scheduling patient referrals and managing the work. The Receiver Portal also provides visibility into our growing Network of providers, referral management reporting and access to Compendium Self-Management, where appropriate..
Interoperability & Operations Effectiveness.
Leverage the largest network in healthcare by building connections with athenahealth. Labratory and imaging orders interfaces are included in our scope of service for athenaCoordinator Core clients (subject to minimum order thresholds) because we believe that interoperability is a win-win for everyone involved; including our athenaClinical EHR users. Mapping your compendiums and Ask at Order Entry questions (AOE's) directly correlates to a higher first-pass clean Order rate and improved labeling of test results. Self-managment is provided through your Receiver Portal..
Secure Communication.
athenaText, our secure text messaging service developed for healthcare, helps providers communicate securely and effectively. Providers can collaborate on care immediately - via mobile or from within our EHR - by sharing text messages, images and medical information without the worry of violating HIPAA compliance. And, for more efficient care collaboration, providers gain access to our directory of over one-million U.S. clinicians and quickly reach care teams or "in-network" providers through preloaded contact groups. Providers can also use athenaText to send annotated messages right from our EHR, withinformation taken from our built-in drug reference app, Epocrates®..
Whether you're an athenahealth provider or not, athenaText is available on your mobile phone for free today. Download it now for iOS.

(d) Except as expressly provided herein, Athena disclaims all representations and warranties of any kind or nature, express or implied (either in fact or by operation of law), with respect to any service or item provided hereunder. Except as expressly provided herein, Athena Property is provided "as is." Athena does not warrant that Athena property will be error-free or will be provided (or available) without interruption or meet Client’s business or operational needs.

(e) No claim against Athena of any kind under any circumstances may be asserted or filed more than one year after Client knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care could know, of any circumstances, whether by act or omission, that may give rise to such claim..
(f) The remedy of a credit with respect to any "Minimum Service Commitment" described in the applicable Service Description will be the sole and exclusive remedy for the acts or omissions of Athena relating to the performance of that Minimum Service Commitment.

(g) Athena’s cumulative, aggregate liability in connection with or arising in any way or in any degree from this Agreement, from athenaNet Services, or otherwise from the acts or omissions of Athena will not exceed the lesser of (i) $500,000, or (ii) the total amount paid by Client to Athena in the 12 months before such claim arose. If damages are measured by the cost of medical services provided or the dollar value of claims submitted, Athena’s liability for such damages will not exceed the service fees attributable to such services or claims. Athena will not be liable for any failure to provide services, content, or functionality with respect to any claim, statement, or transaction that Athena believes in good faith arises from, in connection with, or contains inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise improper information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Athena will not be liable for indirect, exemplary, punitive, special, incidental, or consequential damages or losses; lost profits or business opportunities; loss of data; or the cost of procurement of substitute items or services. Client hereby acknowledges that the remedies set forth above are reasonable and will not fail of their essential purpose..

(a) If a Force Majeure Event prevents a party from complying with any one or more obligations under this Agreement, that inability to comply will not constitute breach if (i) that Party uses reasonable efforts to perform those obligations; (ii) that Party’s inability to perform those obligations is not due to its failure to (x) take reasonable measures to protect itself against events or circumstances of the same type as that Force Majeure Event, or (y) develop and maintain a reasonable contingency plan to respond to events or circumstances of the same type as that Force Majeure Event, and (z) that Party complies with its obligations under Section 10(b) ..
(b) During a Force Majeure Event, the noncomplying party shall use reasonable efforts to limit damages to the other Party and to resume its performance under this Agreement..
Section 11. Mediation .

Section 14. Miscellaneous . This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties relating to athenaNet Services and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, and representations relating to athenaNet Services. Except as otherwise provided herein, no change in this Agreement will be effective or binding unless signed by Client and a duly authorized representative of Athena. Neither Party will assign this Agreement without the written consent of the other, provided that either Party may assign this Agreement with no less than 90 days prior Notice as part of a corporate reorganization, consolidation, merger, change of control with respect to its outstanding stock, or sale of substantially all of its assets, and provided further that the assigning Party and the assignee will remain liable for any unperformed obligations under this Agreement arising prior to the effective date of any such transaction, and any attempt to assign this Agreement not in accordance with this Section 14 shall be null and void. This Agreement is binding on the Parties and their successors and permitted assigns.

Section titles are for convenience only and will not affect the meaning of this Agreement.

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts and exchanged by electronic means, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which together constitute only one agreement between the Parties. The following Sections of this Agreement will survive termination and continue in force: Sections 1 , 2(b) , 3(g) , 5 , 6 , 7(e)(v) , 8(c) - (g) , 9 , and 11 through 14.
